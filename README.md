Weather App
This project demonstrates how to build a simple weather application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenWeather API. Users can enter a city name to get real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and conditions. The app fetches weather data asynchronously via API requests and dynamically updates the page with the retrieved information. It uses Flexbox for layout design and provides a user-friendly interface.
